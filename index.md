# Structure of the GPT

![Customised GPT Overview](GPT_3.png)




## Overview
This page documents the customised GPT described in the paper “A concept for AI supported knowledge extraction in design for additive manufacturing” (Design Conference 2026).

## Workflow
User Input → FLOW configuration → System Instructions → GPT → Output

## Artifact Description
This repository contains supplementary material for documenting the system configuration (FLOW.json), the complete system instructions and illustrative screenshots of a conversation sequence. 

## Disclaimer
The results shown purely document the functionality of the stored decision tree and how to deal with deviations from the prescribed process flow and does not represent an operational implementation.
This GPT was primarily created in German. This can be seen in the FLOW.json file. However, English translations have also been included in the response options. And as shown in the sample conversation (screenshots), it also works in English when requested. The results of the quality of the interpretation of the subject content (scientific papers) are not presented here.
