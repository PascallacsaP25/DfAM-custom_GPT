## Screenshots of the decision tree functionality (implemented in GPT)
Here is the course of a conversation between a user and the GPT. The user only has to answer the questions with numbers. The schematic structure of the GPT is shown below each step. The names and number of questions and answers shown here do not correspond to those of the GPT. The aim here is only to understand the basic functionality.

When a user opens the link to the GPT, this is the start page.

By starting the conversation with a "Hi" the GPT starts asking the first question.

Here, the user decides to proceed with the consolidation of components and types a “3” into the input field.
